Compiling Wyrm
##############

Prerequisites
*************

Like LLVM, we use CMake to generate our local build system and Sphinx to
generate documentation.

Downloading LLVM
================

Wyrm depends on LLVM libraries. As LLVM does not offer a stable API, we require
a specific version of LLVM, currently |wyrm_llvm_version_req|.

The release binaries for LLVM are available for download from the
`releases page <https://releases.llvm.org/>`_ on llvm.org. Download the
appropriate binaries for your operating system and extract them to a directory
outside of the Wyrm repository where they can be used.

Compiling LLVM From Source
==========================

It's also possible to build LLVM from sources, install the libraries somewhere,
and provide that path to Wyrm during configuration.

.. warning:
  LLVM builds are both compute and storage intensive. Even on powerful computers
  builds can take significant time.

See the `LLVM CMake Build Instructions <https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html>`_ for
details about building LLVM with cmake. ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>``.
